            <h2>Outline of my journey at ALX</h2>
            <p>My name is Kgomotso Modikoane and I am currently studying Software engineering and Data Analysis at ALX.
                The institution was founded by a number of people including Fred Swanicker. This program offers online learning
                in high-in-demand IT jobs.
            </p>

            <p>I chose to study Data Analysis with ALX because it is not only free but offered learning in the data analysis.
                I have always wanted to become a data analyst. The program is only 6 months and we are uaranteed career support.
                This means that after ALX trains me for free, they would help me get a job. Even though job placement is not
                guaranteed, my odds are still better with ALX.
            </p>

            <p>It is the 5th of July and I am studying basic HTML in Software Engineering, whereas I studying wireframes in
                my ALX foundations. I am usually exhausted because, I am a full time mom as well. 
                I am juggling a lot in my personal life but it doesn't matter, nothing is gonna stop me!
            </p>
            <h3>In closing...</h3>
            <p>I plan on being among the greatest. I wanna be a big as Viola Davis, Rihanna and Kanye West. Having learned
                about grit and growth, nothing can derail me off of the journey that I have set out for myself. in the famous words
                of Kanye West, "Who gon stop huh?". <br><br>
