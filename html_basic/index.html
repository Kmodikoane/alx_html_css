        <h1>KGOMOTSO MODIKOANE'S ALX JOURNEY</h1>
        <h2>Outline of my journey at ALX</h2>
        <p>My name is Kgomotso Modikoane and I am currently studying Software engineering and Data Analysis at ALX.
            The institution was founded by a number of people including Fred Swanicker. This program offers online learning
            in high-in-demand IT jobs.
        </p>

        <p>I chose to study Data Analysis with ALX because it is not only free but offered learning in the data analysis.
            I have always wanteed to be a data analyst. The program is only 6 months and we are uaranteed career support.
            This means that after ALX trains me for free, they would help me get a job. Even though job placement is not
            guaranteed, my odds are still better with ALX.
        </p>

        <p>It is the 5th of July and I am studying basic HTML in Software Engineering, whereas I studying wireframes in
            my ALX foundations. I am usually exhausted because, I am a full time mom as well. 
            I am juggling a lot in my personal life but it doesn't matter, nothing is gonna stop me!
        </p>
        <p>I plan on being among the greatest. I wanna be a big as Viola Davis, Rihanna and Kanye West. Having learned
            about grit and growth, nothing can derail off of the journey that I have set for myself. in the famout words
            of Kanye West, "Who gon stop huh?".
