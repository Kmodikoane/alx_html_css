        <h1>KGOMOTSO MODIKOANE'S ALX JOURNEY</h1>
        <h2>Outline of my journey at ALX</h2>
        <p1>My name is Kgomotso Modikoane and I am currently studying Software engineering and Data Analysis at ALX.
            The institution was founded by a number of people including Fred Swanicker. This program offers online learning
            in high-in-demand IT jobs.
        </p1>
        <p2>I chose to study Data Analysis with ALX because it is not only free but offered learning in the data analysis.
            I have always wanteed to be a data analyst. The program is only 6 months and we are uaranteed career support.
            This means that after ALX trains me for free, they would help me get a job. Even though job placement is not
            guaranteed, my odds are still better with ALX
