        <h1>KGOMOTSO MODIKOANE'S ALX JOURNEY</h1>
        <h2>Outline of my journey at ALX</h2>
        <p>My name is Kgomotso Modikoane and I am currently studying Software engineering and Data Analysis at ALX.
            The institution was founded by a number of people including Fred Swanicker. This program offers online learning
            in high-in-demand IT jobs.
        </p>

        <p>I chose to study Data Analysis with ALX because it is not only free but offered learning in the data analysis.
            I have always wanted to become a data analyst. The program is only 6 months and we are uaranteed career support.
            This means that after ALX trains me for free, they would help me get a job. Even though job placement is not
            guaranteed, my odds are still better with ALX.
        </p>

        <p>It is the 5th of July and I am studying basic HTML in Software Engineering, whereas I studying wireframes in
            my ALX foundations. I am usually exhausted because, I am a full time mom as well. 
            I am juggling a lot in my personal life but it doesn't matter, nothing is gonna stop me!
        </p>
        <h3>In closing...</h3>
        <p>I plan on being among the greatest. I wanna be a big as Viola Davis, Rihanna and Kanye West. Having learned
            about grit and growth, nothing can derail me off of the journey that I have set out for myself. in the famous words
            of Kanye West, "Who gon stop huh?".

            Fred swanicker is someone who can not be stopped.
            my future mentor spends time with Boris Kodjoe, a sucessful,
            American actore. It doesn't hurt that they are both handsome
